# RELEASE

The Release Process of REST API Explorer is now managed through Travis.

Only someone with Admin access to the project can create a new Release.

The documentation is on [this internal Confluence page](https://alfresco.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/APO/pages/109904136/REST+API+Explorer). 

The Travis builds, however, are visible to everyone at the following address: https://travis-ci.com/github/Alfresco/rest-api-explorer.
